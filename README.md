# It's Gif, Not Jif
My first gSchool personal project was born out of a discussion about animated gifs and the pronunciation of the word.
I found that anyone who has a hard, unwavering opinion regarding how the word is said is _probably_ a little bit of an
asshole. This app is for lovers of gifs (whether they like to call them gifs or jifs) to use as a gif repository, search
engine, and texting platform.
